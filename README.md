# *****ViT-Vision-Transformer*****
ViT-ClassiPy is a lightweight Vision Transformer built from scratch using PyTorch for image classification on datasets like CIFAR-10. It demonstrates patch embedding, positional encoding, transformer blocks, and a custom training loopâ€”ideal for learning transformer-based vision models.
